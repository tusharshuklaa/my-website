[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is a file format and collection of text editor plugins for maintaining consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

```ini
# top-most EditorConfig file
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

This `.editorconfig` file sets the default coding style for all files in the project, ensuring that spaces are used for indentation, with a size of 2 spaces. It also enforces line endings to be LF (Unix style), uses UTF-8 character encoding, and trims trailing whitespace. The last line ensures that a final newline is inserted at the end of files.
