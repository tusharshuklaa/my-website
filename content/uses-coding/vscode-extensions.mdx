[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my code editor of choice, and it has a rich ecosystem of extensions that enhance its functionality. Here are some of the most useful extensions I've found:

1. **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that supports many languages and integrates seamlessly with VS Code. It helps maintain consistent code style across your project.

2. **ESLint**: A powerful linting tool for JavaScript and TypeScript that helps you find and fix problems in your code. The VS Code extension provides real-time feedback and integrates with the editor's built-in features.

3. **Bookmarks**: This extension allows you to bookmark specific lines in your code, making it easy to navigate large files or projects. You can quickly jump between bookmarks and manage them efficiently.

4. **GitLens**: A must-have for any developer working with Git. GitLens supercharges the built-in Git capabilities of VS Code, providing rich insights into code changes, authorship, and more.

5. **GistPad**: GistPad is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to edit GitHub Gists and repositories from the comfort of your favorite editor. I store my code snippets in Gists, and this extension makes it easy to manage and reuse them directly within VS Code.

6. **Indent Rainbow**: This extension colorizes indentation levels in your code, making it easier to visualize the structure of your code, especially in languages like Python where indentation is significant.

7. **Github Copilot**: This extension provides AI-powered code suggestions and completions directly within your editor, helping you write code faster and with fewer errors.

8. **Multiple Cursor Case Preserve**: This extension allows you to change the case of multiple cursors while preserving the original case of each selection. It's particularly useful when refactoring variable names or changing text case in bulk.

9. **Peacock**: Peacock allows you to change the color of your VS Code workspace, making it easier to differentiate between multiple instances of the editor. This is especially useful when working on multiple projects simultaneously.

10. **Pretty TypeScript Errors**: This extension transforms TypeScript error messages into a more readable and user-friendly format, making it easier to spot and fix issues.

11. **Quokka.js**: This is a developer productivity tool for rapid JavaScript / TypeScript prototyping. Runtime values are updated and displayed in your IDE next to your code, as you type.

12. **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: This extension provides intelligent autocompletions, syntax highlighting, and linting for Tailwind CSS classes in your HTML and JavaScript files. It helps you build responsive layouts faster and with fewer errors.

13. **Turbo Console Log**: This extension helps you insert console.log statements quickly and easily. You can select a variable and use a command to generate a console.log statement with the variable name and value, saving you time and effort.

14. **Toggle Quotes**: This extension allows you to toggle between all types of quotes in your code, making it easier to maintain consistent quoting styles.

These extensions have significantly improved my workflow and productivity in VS Code. I highly recommend giving them a try!
