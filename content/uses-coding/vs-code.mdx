When I started my programming journey, everyone around me used [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and to be honest,
it felt very boring to me. My hunger to stay entertained with fancy looks of a code editor introduced me to [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

After some time, I came to know of [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
which is an incredibly powerful and versatile code editor that has become my go-to tool for web development over the past seven years.

Some of the features I can't live without:
* Extensive library of extensions
* Debugging tools
* GIT integration
* Built-in IntelliSense
* Quick info on hover
* Integrated terminal
* And the list goes on and on and on...

Since I'm so hard-bent on making things my own, I've done my fair share of research to find some VS Code extensions that best suit my needs.
You can all of them on this page. Just look for the tag '_vs-code-extensions_'.
