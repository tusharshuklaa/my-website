![A Husky dog and companion Lint on stage, guarding codebase](stop-committing-poor-code "A Husky dog and companion Lint on stage, guarding codebase")

Alright, buckle up, frontend friends! Let's talk about keeping our code clean with [Husky][1] and [lint-staged][2].
No more committing code that's messier than a Delhi&apos;s Tuesday market during Diwali!

## The Problem Statement

<MultiColumn>
We've all been there. You're rushing to commit, thinking, &quot;Chalta hai yaar, baad me dekhta hu&quot; (It&apos;s OK, I&apos;ll check this later).
Then, &quot;later&quot; becomes &quot;never,&quot; and your codebase looks like Salman Khan&apos;s dance scene gone wrong &#8211; beautiful, isn&apos;t it? (pun intended, slowpokes).

![Man dancing with face covered by his t-shirt](salman-dance_sgc8im "Man dancing with face covered by his t-shirt")

</MultiColumn>
<br /><br />

Or may be you pushed code in a hurry only to realize you left a `console.log('debugging forever, YOLO!')` in production?
Or maybe a teammate (definitely not you) pushed some... let&apos;s say questionable code, breaking the build?

<br />
<br />

Ok, let&apos;s take another scenario, imagine that you&apos;ve been working hard on a feature for days.
The sprint is nearing it&apos;s end and you&apos;re short on time. You commit your changes, push to remote, and create a pull request, expecting it to get ~approved~ reviewed _ASAP_.
Then your team lead comments:

```txt
PR rejected: Code doesn't follow style guidelines.
Fix the 47 linting errors and resubmit.
```

Ouch! That's not just embarrassing - it's inefficient. If only there was a way to automatically check your code before committing it...

<br />
That's where Husky and lint-staged come in, like your code's personal bouncers, ensuring only the best gets through.

## What all are we going to cover?

- Setting up [Husky][1] for Git hooks
- Configuring [lint-staged][2] for efficient linting
- Configurations examples for projects of different sizes
- Bonus tips and tricks

## Step 1: Installing Husky - Your Git Hook Guardian

First, let's install Husky. Think of it as your code's "darbaan" (doorman) for Git hooks.

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
```

Or, if you're a yarn aficionado:

```bash
yarn add husky --dev
```

## Step 2: Setting up Husky - First Line of Defense

```bash
# RECOMMENDED
npx husky init
```

This creates a `.husky/` directory in your project root.
In previous version, this was done by `npx husky install` but that isn&apos;t recommended anymore.

<br />
The `init` command creates a `pre-commit` script in `.husky/` and updates the prepare script in `package.json`.
Modifications can be made to suit your workflow.
<br />
For now, let&apos;s open the `pre-commit` file and add some changes: ```bash echo 'Hold the door!... Hodor' ```

Now, every time you try to commit, you&apos;ll see `Hold the door!!...Hodor` printed.
This is the simplest hook, and it proves Husky is working.
You can now change the `echo` statement to something meaningful like:

```bash
npm test
```

Now all of your tests will run before a commit is made.

<br />
<br />

In case you have more scenarios to cover, you can add more hooks in the `.husky/` directory like:

- pre-push
- pre-commit
- post-merge
- post-commit
- post-checkout

And many more! You can checkout all the available options in [Husky&apos;s official documentation.][1]

<br />
<br />

_Why is this needed?_
Imagine you want to run your tests before every commit. This is where pre-commit hooks shine.
They&apos;re your first line of defense against bad code.

> Side Note: "Husky" sounds like a fluffy, loyal, wolf-like dog that guards your house, but in this case, it&apos;s more of a strict gatekeeper that stops bad code from entering the repo. Pair it with `lint-staged` and your dog gets an updated laser-guided sniffing system.

## Step 3: Integrating lint-staged - Selective Cleaning

The problem with running all tests before every commit? It can be painfully slow.
Instead, let&apos;s use lint-staged, your code&apos;s personal "safai karamchari" (cleaning staff).
It only cleans the files you&apos;re about to commit, making it super efficient.

```bash
npm install lint-staged --save-dev
```

Or, with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add lint-staged --dev
```

Add a `lint-staged` configuration to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.js": "eslint --cache --fix",
    "*.css": "stylelint --cache --fix"
  }
}
```

This tells `lint-staged` to run ESLint on all staged JavaScript files and Stylelint on all staged CSS files.
The `--cache` flag speeds things up, and `--fix` attempts to automatically fix any linting errors.

<br />
<br />
*Why is this needed?* Running linters on your entire codebase every commit is like trying to clean the whole
neighborhood when you only need to sweep your front porch. `lint-staged` keeps it focused and fast.

## Step 4: Connecting Husky and lint-staged - Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

Now, let&apos;s get Husky and lint-staged to work together. Update your `.husky/pre-commit` file:

```bash
npx lint-staged
```

This runs lint-staged before every commit. Now, your code will be linted automatically!

<br />
**Example:** If you try to commit a JavaScript file with a missing semicolon, ESLint will automatically fix it before
the commit goes through. It's like having a "jugaad" (hack) that actually works!

## Configuration examples for Different Project Sizes

### Small Projects (Solo Dev or Tiny Team)

For small projects, keep it lightweight:

<MultiColumn>
```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": "eslint --fix"
  }
}
```

![Husky dog guarding a small house](small-project_o4xs1c "Husky dog guarding a small house")

</MultiColumn>
### Medium Projects (Growing Team, Multiple PRs)

Here, we introduce Prettier and TypeScript checking:

<MultiColumn>
![Husky dog guarding a mid-size building](medium-project_vxabjk "Husky dog guarding a mid-size building")

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write", "tsc --noEmit"]
  }
}
```

</MultiColumn>

### Large Projects (Monorepos, Enterprise)

For large projects, we add style linting and unit tests:

<MultiColumn>
```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write",
      "tsc --noEmit",
      "jest --bail --findRelatedTests"
    ],
    "*.{css,scss}": "prettier --write",
    "*.{test,spec}.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": "jest --findRelatedTests"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

With Husky and lint-staged, you'll be committing much cleaner code than Zomato&apos;s pizza delivery (mine is always messed up for some reason).
Think of it like an Indian mom checking your plate before letting you leave the dining table ‚Äî if it&apos;s not clean
(or in this case, well-formatted and linted), you&apos;re **not** going anywhere.

<br />
<br />
*Remember:* Good developers write good code, but exceptional developers automate processes to ensure everyone writes
good code. And much like owning a husky in real life - it takes some commitment and care, but the loyalty and
reliability are worth every bit of effort!
<br />
<br />
Now go forth and write **clean**, **well-formatted**, and **error-free** code! üöÄ
