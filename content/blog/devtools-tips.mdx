import { MultiColumn } from "../../components/multi-column";

A few days ago, I presented a talk at my office on the **hidden gems of Chrome DevTools**.
It was a blast, and I realized that many developers are still unaware of the powerful features that can make their lives easier.

<br />
<br />

A lot of developers use Chrome DevTools daily, but most of them only scratch the surface of its capabilities.
Over the years, I&apos;ve picked up some ridiculously cool (and underused) tricks in [Chrome
DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools). So, I thought, why not share these tips with a wider audience?

## 1. Layouts & Styling

### 1.1 Copy Styles Directly

Ever perfected the styles on an element directly in DevTools, only to manually transcribe each property back to your CSS file?
<br />
No more! You can now copy styles directly from DevTools.
<br />
Right-click on any element in the **Elements tab ‚Üí Copy ‚Üí Copy styles**. Paste wherever you need.

### 1.2 Visualize Flex/Grid
Flexbox and Grid can sometimes be tricky to debug, especially with complex layouts.
<br />
To visualize how your flex or grid layout is structured, you can use the **Flexbox Inspector** or **Grid Inspector**.
To enable it, just:
<br />
<br />

Click that little ‚Äúflex‚Äù or ‚Äúgrid‚Äù badge next to the element in the **Elements panel**.
Chrome will highlight the layout visually‚Äîshowing rows, columns, gaps, alignment zones, etc.
<br />
<br />
Also, scroll down to the `display: flex` or `display: grid` property in the **Styles panel**.
You&apos;ll find icons next to alignment properties ‚Äî clicking those lets you *simulate different flex/grid variations* to preview alignment/mode changes live - no CSS edits needed.

![Flexbox Inspector](flex-inspector_cnvrl0)

## 2. DOM Debugging

### 2.1 Watch Element Changes (‚ÄúBreak On‚Äù)

Picture this: some rogue JavaScript is messing with your DOM. An element is disappearing, or an attribute is changing mysteriously.
<br />
You can catch it in the act using the **‚ÄúBreak on‚Äù** feature in the **Elements panel**.
<br /><br />
Right-click on an element in the **Elements Panel** ‚Üí `Break on` ‚Üí and pick one:

- Subtree modifications (when a child is added/removed)
- Attribute changes (like `class` or `style`)
- Node removal

The debugger _halts JS_ at the exact line making the change. Super useful for finding hidden scripts manipulating the DOM.

![DOM - Break On](dom-break-on_irl0cy)

### 2.2 Quick Element Reference ($0-$4)
Have you ever used `jQuery`? If yes, then I bet you must miss the super-comfy `$` syntax. If not, you can still follow the next tip and be one step closer to being a pro developer.
<br /> <br />
Select an element in the Elements panel. Then go to the Console and type `$0`.
That&apos;s your currently selected element.

<br />
<br />

This is incredibly useful for testing JavaScript interactions. It even remembers your history! `$1` will give you the previously selected element, all the way up to `$4`, so you basically have a stack of the last 5 elements you clicked.

## 3. Console Power Features

### 3.1 `monitorEvents()` for Element Events

Want to see real-time events (click, keydown, etc.) targeting the selected DOM node?

<br />
Just run this in the console:

```Javascript
monitorEvents(document.getElementById('myElement'), 'click');
```

(You can use `$0` too or just pass the actual DOM node.)

### 3.2 Format Console Logs

I used to think that there is nothing fancy in the console logs, until I saw the Facebook's console messages.
![Style console messages like Facebook](style-console-fb_unewwm)

To acheive this, you can use the `%c` directive to apply CSS styles to your console messages.
```Javascript
console.log('%cüöÄ Styling Logs!', 'color: green; font-size: 16px');
```

<br />
You can also use `console.table()` to display arrays of objects in a clean, tabular format.

## 4. AI Features in DevTools

Chrome now ships with **‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù** in multiple panels ‚Äî Elements, Console, Network.
It can help explain errors, suggest fixes, and clarify complex code. It's still evolving, but it gets the job done most of the times.

![AI in Devtools](dom_ai_qpuhpv)

## 5. Network Panel Tricks

### 5.1 Simulate Slow Connections

Click the **‚ÄúNo throttling‚Äù** dropdown in the Network tab and simulate real-world speed testing:

- 4G/3G speed
- Slow CPU
- Offline

![Network throttling](throttling_ewulfd)

### 5.2 Mock API Responses

Right-click on any API call in the **Network panel** ‚Üí `Override content`.
<br />
Now edit the response JSON and hit ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù.
<br />
Your frontend will react as if it got this new fake response from the server.
<br />
This. Is. My. **FAVOURITE**.

### 5.3 Initiators Tab ‚Äî Trace Request Source

Ever wondered what piece of code triggered a specific network request?

<br />
Click on any network request ‚Üí look for the **Initiator tab**
<br />
It shows *exactly which line of code* initiated that request.

![Initiator tab](initiator-tab_zifodw)

### 5.4 Advanced Filters in Network Panel

You can definitely filter network requests based on Fetch/XHR, CSS, JS, Font, Img etc. and even type something in the filter bar to filter requests accordingly but the filter box in the Network tab is more than just a simple search.

<br />
Want to filter only POST requests with 200 status?
<br />
Use: ```text method:POST status-code:200 ``` Or `domain:*.google.com` will show requests made to any Google domain.

## 6. Location, Storage & System

### 6.1 Spoof Your Location

Need to test a feature that depends on the user's location?

<br />
In the **Sensors tab** (hidden under the 3-dot menu > More tools > Sensors), set a fake latitude/longitude.

![Spoof location](spoof-location_dpkyiy)

<br />
Great for testing geo-based experiences like "Show nearest stores."

### 6.2 Find Unused Code with Coverage

If you want to find CSS and JavaScript that your page never even uses and slows down your site, this is the tip that can help.

<br />
Open the Command Menu (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and type 'Coverage' to open the coverage panel.
<br />
**Coverage panel** ‚Üí Click record ‚Üí Browse your site.
<br />
It will show you what CSS and JS are unused.

### 6.3 Paint Flashing

In the Rendering tab (you might need to enable it from the three-dot menu -> More tools -> Rendering), check the "Paint Flashing" option.
Now, as you interact with your page, the browser will highlight in green any area that gets repainted. This is brilliant for identifying performance bottlenecks.
If a tiny hover effect is causing the entire page to repaint, you know you have an optimization opportunity.

<br />
Helps identify:

- Expensive DOM changes
- Animations triggering layout thrashing
- Rage-inducing jank

## 7. Sources Panel & Workspaces

### 7.1 Code Snippets

Do you have handy JavaScript functions that you often use for debugging, like clearing all cookies or displaying hidden form fields?
Go to the **Sources** panel, and on the left pane, find the **Snippets** tab (you may need to click the `>>` icon). Here, you can create, save, and run multi-line JavaScript files within DevTools.

<br />
<br />
You can save reusable JS snippets (like `monitorEvents`, `$0` inspectors, etc.) inside **Sources > Snippets**.
<br />
Run them anytime in any tab.
<br />I keep a bunch of utility snippets [here](https://github.com/tusharshuklaa/chrome-dev-tools-snippets-collection).

### 7.2 Workspaces

Constantly making changes in DevTools and then re-applying them in your code editor? With Workspaces, you can connect a local folder on your machine directly to the Sources panel. Any changes you make to CSS or JS in DevTools will be saved directly to the source file. It&apos;s a seamless two-way street.

## 8. Bonus: Recorder Panel & 3D View

### 8.1 Recorder Panel

The Recorder panel is a powerful tool for automating and replaying user journeys. You can record a sequence of actions (like a login flow or adding an item to a cart), and then replay it, measure its performance, or even export it as a Puppeteer script for end-to-end testing.

<br />
Great for test automation and profiling real UX journeys.

### 8.2 See your page in 3D

![3D View of a web page](3d-view_xafgpp)
This is more of a "wow" feature, but it has its uses! Open the Command Menu, type '3D', and select "Show Layers". This will open a 3D visualization of your page's DOM layers. It can be surprisingly helpful for debugging complex z-index stacking issues.

<br />
<br />
Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge have implemented this feature a little differently, and I like Edge's implementation
more. Check yourself and find what suits you the best.

## Final Thoughts

Phew! That's a lot, but it's just scratching the surface. I hope you found these tips useful.
DevTools is much more than an inspector and logger. Use these features to debug faster, test smarter, and strengthen your frontend workflow.

If you know other underrated tricks, share them!
