I never paid much attention to the keyboard I used until I started using multiple screen setup. Prior to this, it was just my laptop's keyboard and I never had any other option. But the moment I started to use multiple screen, it was a real trouble reaching out for my laptop's keyboard.
The way one setup multiple screens, chances are that you're sitting in the middle of both the screens. And it's irritating to shift your focus to one side while working on another. That's when I reaslised that I need a separate keyboard.

Initially I bought a regular wired keyboard and it did the job well until I visited one of my friend's house. I was very much intrigued by his minimal setup and the keyboard he had.
And then I decided that I wanted one for me too.

The moment you start looking for a good mechanical keyboard, you'll reaslise that they are a little expensive compared to the regular ones.
After my deep research on amazon, flipkart and youtube, I finally settled for [RedDragon K599 Diemos Mechanical Keyboard][1].

This keyboard has some great features like:

- Wireless (with dongle as well as USB wire connection)
- Rechargable (no bateries needed)
- Custom Dustproof Switches (Outemu Red Key Switches)
- 18 different preset RGB lighting modes
- Compact size (but a little heavy - like all mechanical keyboards)
- Amazing battery life
- Solid build quality

I've been using it for more than 2.5 years and have never faced any issue. Typing on it is a breeze and every key stroke makes me want to keep hitting those keys again and again.

In my opinion, regular keyboards are OK but if you really want to boost your typing speed and feel like a PRO coder, you must try a mechanical keyboard. If you're planning to buy one then do your reasearch, you may find something better than mine at a similar price. But if you don't want the hassle, you can find [this keyboard on amazon][1].
