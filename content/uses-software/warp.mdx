Most of the developers don't even realise the need of having another app for terminal and keep on using the good old-faishoned terminal app on MacOS.

As a web developer, the terminal is my constant companion for running servers, installing dependencies, and deploying code. For a long time, I used the macOS Terminal app — functional, but basic.

Then I discovered [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), which was like upgrading from a bike to a sports car.

Recently, I switched to [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/), and now it feels like piloting a spaceship.

### Why Switch?

The macOS Terminal is like plain coffee — it works, but it's nothing special. For web developers craving efficiency, a separate terminal app offers features that boost productivity and make the experience more powerful and pleasant.

### Popular Terminal Apps for macOS

- iTerm2
- Hyper
- Warp

#### iTerm2: The Reliable Workhorse

iTerm2 is a solid upgrade with split panes, advanced search, and customization. For web developers, split panes are a game-changer — run your server, watch builds, and tail logs all in one window.

#### Warp: The Modern Marvel

Warp takes things to the next level. It’s fast, GPU-accelerated, and offers autocompletion, command suggestions, and a sleek interface.
It even has strong and useful AI features in it. This is a huge game-changer as now you need not to remember all the commands.

### Benefits of a Separate Terminal App

- Enhanced Productivity: Save time with features like split panes and autocomplete.
- Customization: Tailor the terminal to your workflow.
- Modern UI/UX: Enjoy a polished, responsive interface.

Switching to Warp felt like moving from a reliable old car to a Tesla—both get you there, but Warp does it with style and smart features. If you're still using the default macOS Terminal, it's time to explore what a dedicated app can do for you.
