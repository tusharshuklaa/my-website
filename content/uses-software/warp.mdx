summary: Most of the developers don't even realise the need of having another app for terminal and keep on using the good old-faishoned terminal app on MacOS.

Most developers stick with macOS Terminal — functional but basic. As a web developer constantly using terminal for servers, dependencies, and deployments, I upgraded from default Terminal to [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) (split panes, customization) then to [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) (GPU-accelerated, AI-powered autocompletion).

### Why Switch?
Enhanced productivity, modern UI, and smart features. Warp feels like upgrading from a budget phone to a premium one — both work, but dedicated terminal apps offer superior efficiency and user experience for serious development work.
