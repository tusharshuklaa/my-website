[Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) is a powerful browser developed by Mozilla.

### Why Firefox Developer Edition?

Firefox Developer Edition is my specialized tool for CSS debugging and testing. Its grid inspector and flexbox tools are unmatched for layout debugging. The responsive design mode and accessibility features help create better websites.

It's free and specifically designed for developers. This browser catches CSS issues that others miss.
